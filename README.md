# Cottage - A little project

---
## Description

Cottage is a small-scale project aimed at centralizing all scientific papers together, in one place. This project was
created because of an Instagram reel I saw, highlighting the problem where millions of scientific papers are published
every year, at different places, making it difficult to keep up with the technology.

## Features

### Basic Features
1. **Accessing a paper**: Access a paper through its name, or code.
2. **Structuring**: Papers are structured, to make it more organized. I/We aim to organize it by: 
```
|- Science:
   1. Biology: [<branches>] 
   2. Chemistry [<branches>]
   3. Physics [<branches>]
|- Math: 
   1. Basic math
   2. Trigonometry
   3. ... (not yet written)
```
After getting to a branch, the user can access a paper directly.
3. **Credits**: Each paper will have credits to the contributors, and the publishing date.

### Future Features
1. Allow users to publish papers written by himself/herself.
2. Create a much more sophisticated search engine.
3. Create a chatbot, that can explain what is meant in the paper.
4. Allow for scientific notation.
